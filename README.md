## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the following resources that were instrumental in developing this Social Media application:

### [React](https://react.dev/)

Offers detailed information and guidelines on React concepts, which were crucial in understanding and implementing features.

### [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs)

Bootstrap provides a comprehensive collection of UI components that significantly enhance the UI of the application. Its responsive design and extensive prebuilt components enable quick and efficient development of visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
